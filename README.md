# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 1. Import required libraries.
 2. Load the Iris dataset.
 3. Convert it into a DataFrame.
 4. Split data into x(features) and y(target).
 5. Split into training and testing sets.
 6. Create ab SGD Classifier.
 7. Train the model.
 8. Make predictions.
 9. Check accuracy.
 10. Show confusion matrix
